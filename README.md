# Certification Work on the DevOps Course

## How it works?
1. Install the following packages:
   - Jenkins (2.387.1)
   - Git
   - Terraform (1.1.7) [It's better to install the latest version]
   - Ansible
2. Create Jenkins Job Pipeline and choose "Pipeline script from SCM".
3. Add repository https link in the git field.
4. Enter your username/password when starting the Pipeline.
5. Attention! You'll have 3 minutes to check the project work.
6. After 3 minutes Terraform will destroy the instances.
7. Thanks for watching :)
